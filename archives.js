He was short and clean-shaven with short “brown-ish” hair and \"an odd density\" to him, though Joshua finds it hard to recall his appearance with certainty. The man introduced himself as “John” and claimed to be from Liverpool, calling himself an \"Englishman inside a foreign land,\" although he did not have a noticeable accent. He told Joshua he was looking for a friend to look after a package for him until he had friends pick it up. He offered £10,000 in cash for this favour, which Joshua accepted. When John left, Joshua regretted the decision, but was not able to leave to chase after John.",

        "statement" : "Statement of Elias Bouchard, Tim Stoker, Sasha James, Martin Blackwood and Jonathan Sims regarding the infestation of the Magnus Institute by the entity formerly known as Jane Prentiss.  On Tuesday Elias had been going over the budgets when the fire alarm went off. As he started to evacuate, Sasha appeared with a tape recorder saying she had set off the fire alarms to get everyone away from Jane Prentiss. Elias agreed that they would have to go and turn on the fire suppression system, but as they left they were confronted with a huge wave of worms and the two became separated. Eventually, Elias got to the fire suppression system, now filled with a CO2 suppressing agent, and eventually turned it on. He heard a scream \"like tens of thousands of things without mouths screaming as one\", Jonathan Sims said.  ",
